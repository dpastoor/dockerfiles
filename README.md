README
=======

This is a repository of personal docker files. These are not 'production'-ready
and can rely on local files or state. The easiest way to see required additional resources
is to check the .gitignore.

Currently this supports the dockerfiles needed to stand up a NONMEM/PsN
instance.

Some of the setup is taken from @billdenny's 
[Pharmacometrics_Docker](https://github.com/billdenney/Pharmacometrics-Docker)
setup, however the goal is to be simple and light on resources.
